# Kerala-Rainfall-Analysis

"Kerala Rainfall Analysis" is a project that aims to help farmers and agriculturists make informed decisions about when to harvest their crops and undertake agricultural activities in Kerala, a state in southern India known for its heavy monsoon rainfall. 

Using this information, farmers and agriculturists can make better decisions about when to plant and harvest their crops, when to apply fertilizers and other inputs, and when to take other measures to protect their crops from excess rainfall or waterlogging. By avoiding planting or harvesting during periods of heavy rainfall or waterlogging, farmers and agriculturists can reduce the risk of crop failure and increase the yield and quality of their crops.

The study includes data cleaning and manipulation techniques using Python and Pandas, data visualization techniques using Matplotlib, and statistical analysis techniques such as time series analysis.
